## How to contribute to GeneticSharp
The idea behind GeneticSharp is to provide the basic and classic components that allow any programmer to quickly create a genetic algorithm using the .NET platform. Therefore, most of the basics and classic operators (crossovers, mutations, selections, reinsertions, and terminations) are implemented on it.

Having said that is not the goal of GeneticSharp to implement or provide all the possible ways to use a genetic algorithm, so, any PR that is not related to new operators, performance improvements, or bug fixing has a great chance to be rejected, but, feel free to read the contributing guidelines below and give a try.

### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
